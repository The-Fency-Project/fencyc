## Current:
- finish unary op
- variable casts
- change local cargo qbe path to git (commit also)
- just continue doing qbe codegen

### Future (from main branch):
- iterators for `for`
- cargo tests
- default args values (?)
- auto type inference for lets
- make error if trying to override func that wasnt declared
now:
- [more] seman for arrays
- // TODO: either add support for getting the same array,
                    // or deny that idea completely.
- passing static arrays ptrs as func arg
- static strings
